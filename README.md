# OpenSearch Plugin for generate QrCodes

Uses an online QrCode generator service. The plugin sends the text searched 
to the API site and returns a picture of the QrCode representing the text.

I found this usefull as a simple alternative to copy-paste text from a desktop
PC to a mobile terminal.
Don't use this tool to convert passwords or other sensible data, everything you
search will be sent to and external site where the effective operation is
performed.

I am not involved in the external site offering the QrCode generation API.

More info on the API are available on the [documentation of the service
provider][1].
